In also contains implemenmtations for correcting detected breaks, currently there are three methods:
  - Linear Model Pair matching
  - Higher Order Moment adjustment (see also https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI3855.1)
  - Quantile Category Matching (see also https://doi.org/10.1175/2010JAMC2376.1)

Documenatation
==============

A detailled documentation will follow shortly...
